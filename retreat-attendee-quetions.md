### Retreat Attendee Terms, Agreements, and Risk Release Form

34. Release Form, please read them carefully.

I acknowledge that participation in the above Thrive Retreat involves risk. 

I, the undersigned, understand and acknowledge that Thrive Ministry will not allow me to participate without releasing and holding Thrive Ministry harmless from any liability arising out of participation in the Thrive Retreat. I have investigated the risks and fully understand and assume such risks on my behalf.

In consideration of the opportunity to participate in the above trip and retreat, I also acknowledge and accept the risks associated with participation in the trip and the retreat.  I acknowledge that I may suffer sickness, personal injury or bodily damage, medical disabilities, loss or theft of personal property, imprisonment, abduction or even death.

I understand and accept personal financial responsibility for any personal injury or bodily damage sustained during the trip.  Further, I promise to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the trip sponsor, Thrive Ministry and its agents, employees, volunteers, or any other representative of Thrive Ministry for any injury related directly or indirectly out of the above trip, whether such injury arises out of the negligence of Thrive Ministry or otherwise.

Should a staff member, volunteer, or retreat attendee need to remain at the retreat location beyond the pre-determined length of the retreat due to unforeseen circumstances, it is the desire of Thrive Ministry to provide emotional and logistical support.  However, Thrive will not be obligated for the cost or to provide a representative to remain with the delayed Participant.

Should an emergency other than medical emergency (terms in previous Terms and Agreements) arise that would delay either a staff member or volunteer beyond the expected departure date, the Thrive Executive team (CEO/COO) should be consulted to determine the implications of the situation and advise how to proceed.  If neither of the Executive Team can be reached, the Board Chair should be consulted.

If a dispute over this agreement or any claim for damages arises, the Participant agrees to resolve the matter through an alternative dispute resolution process.  If the Participant and Thrive cannot agree upon such a process, the dispute will be submitted to a third party arbitrator.

In the event that I suffer any injury or condition during my participation in Thrive activities or transportation, which may endanger my life, cause disfigurement, physical impairment, or undue discomfort if medical treatment is delayed, and as the result of which I am unable, in the opinion of the team leader to make an informed decision regarding such treatment, and a reasonable attempt to contact my designated "emergency contact" have been unsuccessful, to the extent allowed by local law, I hereby appoint the team leader or other staff person present on the Retreat site as my agent to act for me and in my name to make any and all decisions for me concerning my personal care, medical treatment, hospitalization and health care. This Power of Attorney shall terminate in ten (10) days, or when, in the opinion of my attending physician, I am competent to make informed decisions regarding the need for medical treatment, or when the agent is able to contact my designated "emergency contact," 

    - I accept
    - I don't accept
